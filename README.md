# My portfolio as an iOS engineer

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is a portfolio showcasing the iOS applications I have developed using Swift and its frameworks.

Tiati is an iOS-based application that prevents microsleep during driving by detecting various parameters using the iPhoneâ€™s camera. The userâ€™s drowsiness level is determined with a Random Forest model trained using CreateML. MVVM is used as the appâ€™s design pattern

Iâ€™ve mainly contributed in utilizing UIKit, Vision, and CreateML. Iâ€™ve also contributed in the use of design pattern and protocols for a cleaner and more modular code.

Technologies used: 
Vision, UIKit, Create ML, Core Data, AVFoundation

Bobori is an app that is designed to assist first time mothers with sleep training their baby, specifically with the chair method. The app uses EventKit to provide reminders for the baby to sleep and Core Data to save the data locally. 

I mainly worked on the logics and helped with the front end wherever possible. Specifically, I've worked on the profile creation menu, onboarding form, music player, progress bar, core data, and various bug fixes.

Technologies used: 
EventKit, Core Data, SwiftUI, AVFoundation

MRTJ: Live Update is a feature that we developed as a concept for MRT Jakarta. This feature aims to help users of the MRT get live updates regarding the stations, particularly to get the schedule, events, and any potential issues/delays. Firebase is used to allow the admin to update the stations.

Iâ€™ve mainly contributed to the use of Firebase for the CRUD of the app. Iâ€™ve also developed a simple log-in system to allow admin or user to enter the app.

Technologies used: 
Firebase, SwiftUI, Core Location

Missing is an iOS-based escape horror game for the iPad. Players take the role of a high school girl uncovering the mysteries of her school while solving various puzzles.

Iâ€™ve mainly contributed in managing the overall structure of the code, the handling of the scenes as a whole (layouting and combining features) and creating fundamental mechanics (movement, interaction, and dialogue).

Technologies used: 
SpriteKit, GameplayKit, AVFoundation, & UIKit.
